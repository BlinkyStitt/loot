# Loot

Easily divide treasure between a party as fairly as possible


# Quick Setup with Docker

1. Install Docker from https://www.docker.com/

2. Run the following command in your terminal and answer its questions:
```bash
docker run --rm -it bwstitt/loot
```

# Setup without Docker

To install all of the requirements in a virtualenv:
```bash
. setup.source_me
```

Upgrading requirements:
```bash
pip install pip-tools
pip-compile requirements.in
pip install -U -r requirements.txt -e .
```

To enter the virtualenv:
```bash
. env/bin/activate
```

Example run:

```bash

# Todo

 * [ ] Command to add more types of valuables to games yamls (and export them)
 * [ ] If a valuable type isn't recognized, prompt for its value and then save that for later calls
 * [ ] Rename the main function to split and add functions for adding new games and valuables
 * [ ] Clean up ~/.cache during docker runs
